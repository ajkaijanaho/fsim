This is a simple functional language simulator supporting lambda, let
expressions, and simple arithmetic.  The language syntax follows
Haskell, mostly.  The idea is, the simulator allows the user to select
a redex to reduce; this way, they can easily explore different
reduction strategies without doing it by hand.

Just open index.html in Chromium to use, or put this directory up on
http(s) and open it in Chromium.  There are usage instructions on the
page.  Other modern browsers ought to work as well but have not been
tested.

Development happens at https://github.com/ajkaijanaho/fsim .  Bug
reports preferably as GitHub issues.  You may contact me at

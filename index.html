      <h2>Usage</h2>
      <p>
        Write a term of the input language in the provided box.
        Below it, a live abstract syntax tree is displayed;
        if the current term cannot be parsed, an error is shown.
        When you are done, press ENTER; the term appears on the right,
        beginning an evaluation trace.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you hover over a redex in the latest term in the evaluation
        trace, it is highlighted.  Click on a redex and the
        corresponding reduction is performed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The terms of the input language are built from the following
        operations, listed in an increasing order of precedence:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <kbd>let <var>x</var> = <var>term1</var>
                in <var>term2</var></kbd>: Define a local
                variable <kbd><var>x</var></kbd> by
                binding <kbd><var>term1</var></kbd> to it; the
                variable can be used both
                in <kbd><var>term1</var></kbd> (allowing recursive
                definitions) and in <kbd><var>term2</var></kbd>.  The
                value of the whole let term is the value
                of <kbd><var>term2</var></kbd>.
            </li>
            <li>
              <kbd>\ <var>x</var> -&gt; <var>term</var></kbd>: A
              lambda abstraction, defining <kbd><var>term</var></kbd>
              an anonymous function of the
              variable <kbd><var>x</var></kbd>.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <kbd><var>term1</var> + <var>term2</var></kbd>: Ordinary
              arithmetic addition.
            </li>
            <li>
              <kbd><var>term1</var> - <var>term2</var></kbd>: Ordinary
              arithmetic subtraction.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <kbd><var>term1</var> * <var>term2</var></kbd>: Ordinary
              arithmetic multiplication.
            </li>
            <li>
              <kbd><var>term1</var> / <var>term2</var></kbd>: Ordinary
              arithmetic division.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <kbd>- <var>term</var></kbd>: Ordinary arithmetic negation.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <kbd><var>term1</var> <var>term2</var></kbd>:
              Function application.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <kbd><var>x</var></kbd>: Variable reference.  Free variables
              are prohibited; all variables must be bound by a let or a
              lambda.  Variable names start with a lowercase letter.
            </li>
            <li>
              <kbd><var>C</var></kbd>: Constructor reference.
              Constructors are like free variables that cannot be
              bound by lambda or let.  Constructor names start with
              an uppercase letter.
            </li>
            <li>
              <kbd>( <var>term</var> )</kbd>: Parentheses to control
              disambiguation.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        All binary operators associate to the left.
